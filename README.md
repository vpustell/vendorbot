# vendorbot
building a bot to serve new vendor onboarding requests

this is a first, very rough, pass at building a Slack slash command to request security review of new vendors.
being built in Node because I'm doing some noodling and learning of Node :shrug:

in channel: /vendor to request a new vendor

activates dialog with Qs about the vendor

triages to security level and posts the Qs in-channel with corresponding circle

DMs user that their request has been submitted

adds this information to a Google Sheet for security team



future feature objectives:

reacji action triggers

interaction with Standard Fusion API


this README will be improved once there's some actual code in here, derp
